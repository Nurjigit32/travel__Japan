                    <p>Japan, island country lying off the east coast of Asia. It consists of a great string of islands in a northeast-southwest arc that stretches
                        <br> for approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km) through the western North Pacific Ocean. Nearly the entire land area is taken up by the country’s
                        <br> four main islands; from north to south these are Hokkaido <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1101.html">(Hokkaidō)</a>, Honshu
                        <a href="https://travel.gaijinpot.com/destination/honshu/">(Honshū)</a>, Shikoku, and Kyushu <a
                                href="https://www.visit-kyushu.com/en/">(Kyūshū)</a>. Honshu is the largest
                        <br>of the four, followed in size by Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. In addition, there are numerous smaller islands, the major groups of which are
                        <br>the Ryukyu <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/05/02/national/nansei-islands-defense/">(Nansei)</a>  Islands (including the island of Okinawa) to the south and west of Kyushu and the Izu, Bonin
                        <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e8200.html">(Ogasawara)</a>, and Volcano <a href="#">(Kazan)</a>
                        <br> islands to the south and east of central Honshu. The national capital, Tokyo <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/destinations/kanto/tokyo/">(Tōkyō)</a>, in east-central Honshu, is one of the world’s most populous cities.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">The Japanese landscape is rugged, with more than four-fifths of the land surface consisting of mountains. There are many active and dormant volcanoes, including Mount Fuji (Fuji-san), which, at an elevation of 12,388 feet (3,776 metres), is Japan’s highest mountain. Abundant precipitation and the generally mild temperatures throughout most of the country have produced a lush vegetation cover and, despite the mountainous terrain and generally poor soils, have made it possible to raise a variety of crops. Japan has a large and, to a great extent, ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily concentrated in the low-lying areas along the Pacific coast of Honshu.</p>
